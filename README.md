Arbore is a peer-to-peer file sharing application with the following caracteristics:
- targeted for private/low diffusion data between people that know each-others. Main use case: friends want to share between each-others their holidays pictures.
- low friction: it should be as easy as possible
- encryption should be used to maintain privacy and to control the diffusion of the data

This application is build on top of [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/).

## ROADMAP

### Version 1 (minimal first version)
* profile management
* basic contact management (adding with a hash)
* targeted sharing (notification and download)
* basic 1 to 1 chat

### Version 2 (encryption and chat)
* encryption (IPFS is currently working on encryption)

### Version 3
### contact-related features: 
* public sharing and contact following (kind of like Twitter)
* contact suggestion and privacy settings
* contact blocking (for abuse)
* contact groups
* contact management: mitigation strategy (maintaining your contacts files online because you like them)
* profile "migration" with notification of contacts
* on-demand custom app packaging with a first contact for extra-simple onboarding

### content-related features:
* reliable and efficient download status tracking (when available; details ipfs/go-ipfs#3866)
* reception confirmation
* content: re-share
* better share description, maybe with markdown ?
* content: fancy share's content visualization (for instance, for pictures with a slideshow or carousel)
* internationalization

### misc:
* mobile version using react native
* enhanced chat (offline, history, group chat, encryption ...) maybe using orbit.chat
* ability to close the main windows while still having the app running + system tray icon with stats
